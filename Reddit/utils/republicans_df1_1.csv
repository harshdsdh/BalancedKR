So back in may, Gavin Newsom implemented a mask mandate, here in California, so then so I started wearing Trump masks to stores (when required) and I started realizing that more and more people have been giving me thumbs up even saying how much they like it (and yes I've gotten dirty looks).  I live in Orange County for context and this used to be a not so conservative county, I couldn't even wear a MAGA hat here without being insulted, but now there's something happening here in California, and it isn't happening in OC, it's happening it other places, there is a red wave happening in California.  We have been told that California is lost but I don't think that's the case (I know there's a lot of Democrats here) but at the same time, Newsom has destroyed our state and caused people to wake up.  I just wanted to share this because if you're not from CA, you wouldn't see what I'm seeing.  The amount of Conservatives liking my mask and giving me thumbs up shows that there is still hope for California.  The silent majority is very present here in California and I just wanted to share this.",-1,"california back may , gavin newsom implemented mask mandate , california , started wearing trump masks stores ( required ) started realizing people giving thumbs even saying much like ( yes 've gotten dirty looks ) . live orange county context used conservative county , could n't even wear maga hat without insulted , 's something happening california , n't happening oc , 's happening places , red wave happening california . told california lost n't think 's case ( know 's lot democrats ) time , newsom destroyed state caused people wake . wanted share 're ca , would n't see 'm seeing . amount conservatives liking mask giving thumbs shows still hope california . silent majority present california wanted share ."

What do you guys think? I think it’s good that he’s looking at VA as an option Incase he loses a midwestern state. That said, I think the president wins Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, good shot at Nevada so if Trump can continue focusing on his record vs Biden and does really well on election night, I think he’ll do really well on election night.

Yes, there’s the issues with mail in balloting but Democrats are usually the ones more likely to vote by mail this election so if there’s uncertainty over ballots, I feel like it hurts them more than if they just told people from the beginning to just vote in person even if it’s early voting. I think the combination of early voting totals, turnout on election night, how close the states are means we could be able to call the race on election night. 

I guess the big thing is go out and vote so the race isn’t close and they can call it November 3rd.",-1,"virginia play ? ’ live va think president chance win virginia campaigns lot , sure northern va ’ influence dc . think trump focuses economy , jobs , military , possibly win . guys think ? think ’ good ’ looking va option incase loses midwestern state . said , think president wins florida , michigan , minnesota , pennsylvania , good shot nevada trump continue focusing record vs biden really well election night , think ’ really well election night . yes , ’ issues mail balloting democrats usually ones likely vote mail election ’ uncertainty ballots , feel like hurts told people beginning vote person even ’ early voting . think combination early voting totals , turnout election night , close states means could able call race election night . guess big thing go vote race ’ close call november 3rd ."

134,Do Republicans Need Better Marketing?,"So I am a Florida Millennial (late 30s) even if I don't like identifying with many of my fellow millennials. I have been thinking over the last week that it seems the Republicans need to get their marketing into 2020. I started thinking about this after my wife mentioned she never hears any republican ads on the radio and I realized that neither do I, nor do I see any on the streaming TV news.

It is all Democrats all the time. She primarily listens to Spotify and Pandora and I listen to IHeart Radio (for talk stations) and Pandora, all you ever hear are Biden and Pam Keith ads. The same goes for the morning TV news, its constant Biden and Pam Keith ads, now I only watch streaming so maybe on the broadcast news (is that still a thing?) they have Trump or Brian Mast ads.

I did get a mailer from Brian Mast but really who even looks at that stuff, in the recycle bin it goes. So my point is if most people my age and lower are only ever exposed to a constant drivel of Democratic candidate ads who does one expect them to vote for? Why does the Republican party as a whole and the candidates not do a much better job on advertising? Running ads on Pandora or Spotify is not very expensive and since there are a very limited number of ad slots you have a much better chance of the listener actually hearing it.",-1,"republicans need better marketing ? florida millennial ( late 30s ) even n't like identifying many fellow millennials . thinking last week seems republicans need get marketing 2020. started thinking wife mentioned never hears republican ads radio realized neither , see streaming tv news . democrats time . primarily listens spotify pandora listen iheart radio ( talk stations ) pandora , ever hear biden pam keith ads . goes morning tv news , constant biden pam keith ads , watch streaming maybe broadcast news ( still thing ? ) trump brian mast ads . get mailer brian mast really even looks stuff , recycle bin goes . point people age lower ever exposed constant drivel democratic candidate ads one expect vote ? republican party whole candidates much better job advertising ? running ads pandora spotify expensive since limited number ad slots much better chance listener actually hearing ."

307,"I have to point out something. Democrats have made RBG out to be a really, REALLY shitty person.","According to Democrats, RBG's granddaughter said that RBG's dying wish was to have her slot on the Supreme Court filled by a different president.  

Now Democrats are trying to spin the filling of the vacant seat as disrespecting a dying woman's final wish.  

There's a big, **big** problem with that logic, though.  It means RBG was a small, hateful, bigoted woman, an all around shitty person.  

First, it means she is egotistical in the extreme.  She thinks that she has held her seat to such a high standard that president Trump, even if he wins re-election, is unworthy to replace her at all for a full four year term.  That's arrogant. 

Second, it means she is a hateful partisan, **precisely the type of person who should have never held the seat in the first place!**  She hates the Republican president so much that she doesn't think he deserves to appoint justices.  Someone who is that hyperpartisan doesn't belong anywhere near the highest court in the land, and if that's who Democrats hold in such high esteem then Republicans should take every conceivable step to deny them **any** consideration in who fills a judge position at any level.  

Lastly, if these words are true, it is an extremely offensive insult to justices Kavanaugh and justice Gorsuch.  If it offends RBG so much to be nominated by Trump then it follows logically that she must despise his prior two nominees and must believe them to be unworthy as justices.  Again, this is extremely arrogant and hateful.

In their attempts to moralize over this issue, Democrats have unwittingly turned RBG into a pitiful excuse of a human being, an arrogant, hyperpartisan bigot.  Do I think that about RBG?  No.  But more and more people are going to think so if Democrats keep pushing this bullshit story about her dying wish being not to be replaced by Trump.  That turns her whole legacy into a petty, personal, hateful fight with a single president.  Personally, I don't think a woman who served on the highest court longer than any president or any three presidents put together have served is that petty.  

Leftists, once again you have let your anger and blind hatred lead you on a path of wanton destruction.  And this time, it's not just Republicans or the system that you are trying to set ablaze.  It's a 27 year Supreme Court Justice that was on your side.",-1,"point something . democrats made rbg really , really shitty person.according democrats , rbg 's granddaughter said rbg 's dying wish slot supreme court filled different president . democrats trying spin filling vacant seat disrespecting dying woman 's final wish .

311,The case for barbara lagoa,"The Republican party of 2020 is not the Republican party of 2000. No longer is it the home of wealthy, affluent, influential and unaffected elites who couldn't care less about their constituency and their issues. 

Today the Republican party is the party of American workers, of people that have struggled, that have worked their way up to a decent standard of living through sacrifice, hard work, tears, blood and sweat. It is the party of the military, the party of the common man, the party of social morality, the party of individual freedom, of decent work and the party of aspiration.

Barbara Lagoa is the justice of now and future Republican party. She was born the child of refugees fleeing communist dictatorship. She was raised in the then industrial town of Hialeah, Florida surrounded by those that escaped communism and who rebuilt their lives in a new land. A town that stood for common sense, hard work and the age old tales of the typical immigrant.

She stood by her community in 2000 when she represented, without charge, Elian Gonzalez and his grandparents against the Communist government of Cuba and the Clinton administration which stole the child in the dark of night from his grandparents and deported him back to a depraved and starved nation.

She has stood by the law as it is written. But more importantly, she knows what it is to fight for what she has, and she knows the struggle of the working people of this country. She is not the child of a millionaire whose word you cannot trust, she is not a professor that was groomed to be where she is today, she is a fighter that has gotten to where she is by her smarts, her fight and her will.

She will not be John Roberts II, she will be Antonin Scalia II. If she is nominated by President Trump she will not only secure the Latino vote throughout the country, she will secure the election of Donald Trump both by her prescence in the Supreme Court and as inspiration and evidence to the voters of this country that the President stands for the legal immigrant and working class of this country.

I urge you to call your representatives and urge them to ask Donald Trump to simply take a meeting with Lagoa. What she will present to him is someone who mirrors him, a fighter, a scrapper who will risk her skin for the common folk of the country and be a reliable, *conservative* Supreme Court Justice.

403,The black lives matter Movement is the Largest Scale Mass Hysteria Incident in Modern History - In Depth Discussion,"The blm movement is going to be remembered as one of society's largest scale incidents of mass hysteria built on overt lies and hatred. By nature of their support, hundreds of thousands of otherwise good people are socially endorsing the violence that arises from these hateful ""causes"" based on utter fabrications.

**The definition of terrorism: the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.**

Whether you support their cause or not, both blm and antifa as organizations fit the literal definition of terrorism. If you don't call them that yourself, that's fine, until recently neither did the American government, but merely saying that they aren't terrorists because you might think they have a reason for their actions is a subjective opinion on something that is otherwise an objective fact. blm/antifa and their supporters are responsible for a great number of increasingly violent attacks in recent years targeted towards opposing views (namely white people and Trump supporters), where they've earned the ire that's currently directed towards them. It's time we collectively began to address these left-wing extremists for what they truly are.

black lives matter as both an organization and as a ""social statement"" were founded primarily on the basis of ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"". Both of which have very little merit outside of left-wing echochambers, with almost all of its messaging crumbling under the slightest bit of scrutiny (if it's supporters ever bothered to scrutinize what they are being indoctrinated by).

""Systemic racism"" is a catch-all term for any and everything to do with race, applied ad hoc to whatever scenarios people would like changed, whether that's in the public and private school systems, our systems of law and the histories of great nations. No legal definition or even standard application of the word has been decided, and everyone has their own variation on what the word means. And yet, [governmental bodies themselves](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ends-critical-race-theory-training-federal-employees) and [people are changing the way we act, talk and think](https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/reasons-critical-race-theory-terrible-dealing-racism/) in order to combat [this vague THEORY (and I stress that word)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ujq4iAgUMw&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=FreethePeople).

""Police brutality"" has been a term applied to virtually any instance of law enforcement being applied with force (and sometimes even without it), specifically and especially in regards to any crime committed by someone of the black community. Repeated study after study of police shootings has disputed any notion of ""racism"" being a factor in police shootings, and yet the stereotype of ""evil, racist police"" continues to spread. Some studies have even shown the opposite to be true, that white officers are less likely to shoot black suspects, and adjusted for ratios in crime and population white suspects are more likely to be shot by cops (various studies to follow below). And yet, every time a black person is killed by police, regardless of whether or not they were resisting arrest or actively trying to hurt or kill other people, the ""police brutality"" and ""racism"" cards have been pulled to demonize lawful shootings to undermine the faith citizens have in their police and government.

Here are some facts and statistics (or what would probably be considered the real enemy to the blm movement...the truth).

[In American cops make about 10,000,000 arrests a year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191261/number-of-arrests-for-all-offenses-in-the-us-since-1990/). Those ten million arrests don't include detentions, traffic stops or any of the other peaceful public interactions that make up the remaining approximately 60,000,000 police and citizen contact every year. [On average per year, only about 1,000 of those 70 MILLION people interacted with end up dead due to police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/). Yet, people act like their chances of dying at the hands of a cop are anything but minuscule. The entire blm narrative is built on the foundation of ""police brutality"" and ""racism"" that simply isn't reflected in reality.

We're not even going to begin to discuss how many of those 1,000 people killed by cops each year are armed and dangerous (which is the majority of cases), or how many of them aren’t black (also the majority). It's also important to note that in police reporting ""unarmed"" does not mean ""not violent"". We can even assume, for the sake of argument, that none of those 1,000 police killings each year are justified (even though the vast majority of them are). The ratio of unarmed black men shot and killed (23) in 2018 was 1 out of 67,334 black men arrested. [According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, there were 686,665 sworn police officers in the United States in 2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-74). That’s one unarmed black male shot and killed for every 49,047 sworn police officers. [Out of the nearly 47.8 million black Americans](https://blackdemographics.com/), the police have shot roughly one unarmed black male per roughly 2.1 million people.

[The inevitable conversation that follows is that black people only represent 14% of the US population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219)**,** how is it that they make up such a high number of overall police deaths\*\*.\*\* blm and it's supporters would like to propagate the idea that it's racism. Which fortunately has little factual basis in this topic. This is where we need to have those brutal, honest conversations that everyone claims to want to have regarding race (silence is violence after all), but nobody is actually allowed to discuss without being banned, canceled or called a racist nazi.

[In the US, the American black population represents 53% of convicted murders, 29% of rapes, 54% of robberies, 33% of assaults, 43% of weapons charges, 29% of domestic abuse and 27% of drug abuse violations among others (continuing to over index in almost all areas of remaining crime)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43). The vast majority of these crimes were conducted by males, meaning that half of the violent crime in America is committed by less than the roughly 6-7% of black men in the US. It's not only understandable but expected that there would be a higher degree of violence involved in these arrests, as usually the type of person that's being arrested for murder isn't likely to go without a fight, nor would they like to spend their lives in prison. Ignoring these facts is tantamount to delusion.

Almost all studies that conclude that black people are killed disproportionately fail to factor in crime rates into their models, whether on purpose to reach a desired conclusion or via a poor scientific process. Those are very relevant statistics that cannot be ignored when discussing police interactions with black people, nor can they be discarded in studies, as they help to explain why there is a disparity between the black population and arrests/deaths. Many who like to dismiss these figures do so by doing what they always do, and cry ""racism"", whether it's the mere use of these statistics or in the very core of every single arrest that makes up the data.

But simply hand-waving away the reason that there are so many violent interactions between the black community and the police due to ""racism"" is disingenuous and deliberate. The reasons behind those crime rates and why the black community is plagued by crime are extraordinarily complicated, and very well may contain elements of race and racism reaching back decades (such as the Welfare system and Jim Crow laws), but that’s an entirely separate conversation for another day unrelated to the premise of ""police brutality towards blacks"". The fact of the matter is, the black community has and will continue to have problems with overwhelming violence without real intervention, and its these problems that lead to further violent interactions with police.

[Keeping the aforementioned statistics in mind, each year, American cops kill more white people, both in raw numbers and when adjusted for crime rates, than black people](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) (note: the study has since been retracted due to public inference, however, the data included remains valid, even more studies with similar findings below). Only roughly .009% of all arrests ended with a civilian death regardless of race, and for every 10 deadly weapon assaults on a police officer there was as a result of 1 fatal police shooting, or in other words, even in encounters with deadly weapons police will only fatally shoot about 10% of the time. [In fact, research done by the National Police Research Platform, only roughly 27% of those 680,000+ officers report ever even firing their gun on duty](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/) (which doesn't specifically entail actually shooting someone either, just the fact that they've shot their weapon). And yet the narrative of blood thirsty police persists.

Contrary to the black lives matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police.[In 2015, black civil-rights commissioner Peter Kirsanow famously defended the police](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/narrative-racist-police-killings-melts-when-you-know-these-stats) by acknowledging that [a police officer is roughly 18.5x more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer, a number that's been repeated ad nauseam and is roughly supported by statistics year after year (it lowers to roughly 2.5x more likely for a cop to be killed by armed black males than the reverse)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2018/topic-pages/officers-feloniously-killed). Factually, black males have made up nearly 50 percent of all cop-killers over the last decade even though they are only 6-7% of the overall population.

White people make up roughly over 50% of known race homicide victims, with caucasians representing roughly 76% of the total US population. Black people were 45% of known race homicide victims, but only 13% of the population. Which means the homicide rate for blacks was 3.5x their percentage of the US population, making them over five times as likely to be homicide victims.

According to a [Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 study, 15.3% of violent crimes against whites were committed by blacks for a total of 547,948 crimes, with violent black offenders being 1.8x their percent of the population](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf). In contrast, whites committed 10.6% of violent crimes against blacks for a total of 59,777 crimes, making up 0.8x their percentage of the population. But of violent crime against black people, 70% of the time the offender was reported by the victim themselves as black, which is supportive of the epidemic of black-on-black violence increasing across the country. The offender to victim ratio shows that violent incidents involving black offenders (22%) was twice the percentage of black victims (11%). 

Hate crime statistics actually show that in recent years, anti-black incidents overall fell to a recent record low share of all hate crime, while anti-white and other races have seen increases in hate crime towards them. [Meanwhile hate crimes committed by black offenders continues to increase year over year, reaching a high of 24% of all reported hate crimes despite making up only 14% of the population](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018). In major cities such as [New York, black perpetrators make up the majority of hate crimes towards Jewish and LGBT people](https://nypost.com/2019/11/25/what-the-left-doesnt-want-to-mention-about-new-york-city-hate-crimes/), again, despite the narrative that says black people are society's current victims of discrimination.

People need to stop acting like, just because they’re black, they’ll die if they interact with the cops or that white people are targeting black people with racism and hatred. Of course in a country of hundreds of millions of people there is going to be anti-black racism. But it certainly isn't to the degree in which activists like to perpetuate, [such as it being a public health crisis](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/health/states-racism-public-health-crisis-trnd/index.html). Statistics simply do not reflect any reality in which this absurdity is true, unless a concentrated effort is put into disqualifying and discounting data that opposes the narrative. If anything, the crime data, statistics on police shootings and the general modern societal zeitgeist would suggest an active and ongoing discrimination against whites. But hey, that's another topic for another day isn't it.

The questions that decent human beings need to seriously ask themselves in regards to police is, are you committing crimes? Are you going to resist if the cops try to arrest you? I would hope not for both of those questions. In 2020, there's no excuse for that level of ignorance. Therefore, your chances of dying at the hands of the police are virtually zero. But, the best part is, even if you are committing crimes and resisting arrest, your chances of dying at the hands of the police are still virtually zero, regardless of your skin color or particular demographic.That's the statistical fact. No matter how many slogans are chanted or how many times ACAB is gratified onto buildings, it doesn't suddenly mean the police are out to kill anyone.

The gaslighting from the media and the blm supporters claim that the violent actions of a ""few"" rioters do not represent most of the ""peaceful group"" (a courtesy not extended to the legitimately mostly peaceful police). [The left-leaning Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project reports that in the summer of 2020 alone (not including the continued riots in September) there were 7,750+ demonstrations related to blm](https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/). Of those, over 1000 included some sort of assault on police and/or bystanders, arson or looting but yet were not declared riots.

Over 570 of those ""peaceful protests"" in 220 locations turned violent to the degree that they were declared riots. That's 570+ ""mostly peaceful protests"" barely covered by mainstream news, that seemingly most supporters of blm refuse to acknowledge even occurred, which included an [estimated $2 billion dollars in damages (most of which isn't covered by insurance, done to local family businesses, many black owned)](https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2020/07/06/298012.htm), along with a few dozen related fatalities (including targeted, accidental and incidental, more to follow below) and countless incidents of arson, looting and assault against bystanders and police. ACLED also stated that of those demonstrations, only 5% of them have been met with force by police, which is obviously roughly the same percentage of ""protests"" that become violent riots.

Only of course the media and blm supporters would like you to believe that police (by way of ""fascist"" Trump) are arresting and attacking ""peaceful protesters utilizing their 'freedom of speech'"", which couldn't be further from the truth. The freedom of speech was designed to protect people from those who think violence is the solution to democratic problems. [Inciting violence was written in as an exception to the amendment, in part so that people couldn't use strength against others to assert beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action). There's legal and historical precedence for proper ""freedom of speech"" and ""freedom to protest"", and nobody should care about the personal interpretations of rioters and terrorists on those fundamental freedoms.

And yet here we are, in a society where the mainstream media, an extraordinarily vocal minority of citizens, [multinational billion dollar businesses donating hundreds of millions to the cause](https://conservativefiringline.com/list-of-269-companies-supporting-antifa-black-lives-matter/) that [partially goes to fund rioters' bail from jail after arrests](https://trendingpolitics.com/here-is-the-list-of-celebrities-paying-bail-for-violent-rioters-and-looters/) ([multiple criminals who](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/portland-rioter-arrested-double-murder-one-week-portland-officials-let-off-interfering-police-downtown-protest/) then went on to [commit other murders](https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/09/12/chicago-gun-store-looter-released-murders-walgreens-clerk/)), celebrities and sports teams are all siding with blm over blatantly false lies and misinformation. All the while supporting the notion that black people are being ""oppressed and victimized"". None of their opinions on equality, inclusive ideologies and the freedom of speech, actually extends to the mostly peaceful police officers, towards white people, or any other demographic that condemns these actions ([such as the increasing number of liberals leaving the party #WalkAway,](https://www.walkawaycampaign.com/) or the [various minority groups now increasingly supporting Trump](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/514174-poll-trump-approval-rises-among-black-hispanic-voters)). People need to forgo emotional arguments for rational analysis, stop confusing correlation with causation, and understand the impact of confounding variables and their own bias in these discussions.

Because what is happening is society and the Regressive Left is fostering an environment based on hate in the name of acceptance, including the willful return of [Segregation](https://pjmedia.com/columns/matt-margolis/2019/06/24/democrats-were-the-party-of-segregation-years-ago-and-they-still-are-today-n120433), [Affirmative Action](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/24/california-legislature-repeals-proposition-209-places-race-based-affirmative-action-on-ballot/) and identity politics based on race, the demand for reparations ([despite the Welfare system predominately geared towards blacks, having spent $22 TRILLION in the past 50 years towards poverty, costing 3 times as much as all of America's wars since the Revolution](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/the-war-poverty-after-50-years)), special considerations in academia (like [lowered admission standards or testing requirements](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/06/07/fairness-means-lowering-bar-education-column/673198002/), even though [more money is spent on additional education funding for black students than any other race](https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-myth-racial-disparities-public-school-funding)**,** and [racial quotas hurting Asian Americans](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-affirmative-action-and-asian-americans)), the desire to rid society of capitalism ([while hypocritically selling copious amounts of branded merchandise](https://store.blacklivesmatter.com/store/)), [two parent households](https://www.dailywire.com/news/black-lives-matter-what-we-believe-page-disrupt-the-western-prescribed-nuclear-family-dismantle-cisgender-privilege) (which has now quietly been removed due to criticism) and the [abolishment of police and prisons](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/07/17/black-lives-matter-activist). [Democrats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQzLcO5qhY&ab_channel=HarveyC) and [blm leaders](https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-leader-if-change-doesnt-happen-we-will-burn-down-this-system/) have continually called for public violence, including [attacks on police](https://twitter.com/BrendonLeslie/status/1299896694088388609) and [white folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxwueUxE-8c&ab_channel=SmoothMedia), with the [demonization of white people](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1610610/smithsonian-aspects-white-culture.webp?w=790&f=ab12077631acab2dac02fd587b3f4f15) as a [sub-human race](https://quillette.com/2018/07/13/the-rise-and-decline-of-black-lives-matter-a-toronto-case-study/) and [as racist demons](https://www.redstate.com/mike_miller/2020/09/08/ever-seen-a-woke-instructor-teach-a-roomful-of-white-people-theyre-racist-sub-human-demons-here-ya-go.../).

Compound this with the contrasting fact that [nearly 80% of the black community not only disagrees with the notion of defunding the police, but a significant portion would like to see either the same amount or more police presence in their neighborhoods](https://news.gallup.com/poll/316571/black-americans-police-retain-local-presence.aspx). As anyone who grew up in a crime ridden black community knows (such as myself), a lack of policing only hurts the people that [soft-bellied liberals claim to want to help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5-mc4U_Zw&ab_channel=TheDailyWire). If any of the organizations and rioters actually cared about black lives mattering, then they would be focusing on the real tragedies occurring within their own communities. Such as the uncontrolled black-on-black violence, drug use and absentee fathers, and not whatever viral case makes the news in order to further the political agenda. [The black community that actually deals with the rampant violence and gangs realize that defunding police is tantamount to forfeiting their lives and the lives of loved ones](https://www.chicagotribune.com/data/ct-shooting-victims-map-charts-htmlstory.html).

If the two tenants of the blm and antifa supporters are based on ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"" and both are built on misinformation and lies, then what are all of the riots, looting, arson and murder actually for? Why as a society have we both allowed and endorsed these horrific actions to the point of normalcy? Why is it so difficult for liberals to disavow the actual closest things our generation has seen to Nazism?

[Why does the violence inspired by the ""blm cause"" not count as extremism other than social bias of the people who believe in it](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/07/how_the_left_creates_fake_studies_to_fabricate_rightwing_terrorism.html) (despite glaringly obvious examples that say otherwise)? Defenders would like to argue that just because these killers and anarchists believed in the blm narrative, doesn't mean they have killed all those cops or Trump supporters specifically for blm. And just because people aren't card carrying members of antifa, then obviously they aren't rioting specifically for antifa...it's all just a magical coincidence that they buy their branded t-shirts and wave their affiliated flags.

But yet, if an individual police officer happens to kill a black man in the line of duty, that's somehow representative of all officers and ""systemic racism"" according to these same groups. We wouldn't excuse this type of behavior if it had been done in the name of ISIS. We wouldn't judge an act of terrorism on whether or not it's followers actually traveled to Syria before stabbing someone in the throat. Like logical, intelligent human beings we would determine their guilt via their extremist beliefs and horrific actions, which at this point is undeniable despite the feverish attempts to deny virtually all of it (a relatively small list compared to all incidents of blm and antifa inspired attacks to follow).

When we have such divergent attitudes in the way the very cultures and people of various races approach life, are we still feigning surprise that there's a difference in terms of wealth, crime, education, economic or job status between races? Eventually we need to be honest and look at how people actually behave and how society functions, instead of playing pretend and arguing about microagressions and white fragility.

Allowing this toxic blm rhetoric continue in this state for political reasons is entirely the opposite of being respectful of other views and is a direct attack on democracy. The sheer unfathomable damage done for this ""cause"" will go down in history as one of the worst decisions our society has ever inflicted upon itself perpetuated by the willful ideological delusion of one political side and its ever increasingly unstable base. If there are any blm supporters still reading this, I implore you to reconsider your stance. You can be against racism and support the real black community without endorsing the hate and lies of the blm organization. There is no requirement to martyr violent criminals just because they died while being black.

Please. If you're honestly trying to do what's best for society and the real black families adversely affected, ensure you're not on the wrong side of history while doing it.

Edit: Please feel free to copy and paste this information where you see fit, I know not everyone interested in these conversations wants to do the leg-work and a lot of the discussions revert back to the same topics (crime rates, demographics, studies, etc). And rather than ""own"" a stupid Reddit post, I would rather see more people discussing the realities of this situation with the most concrete information.

\*\*\*\*

[2019 Study from Michigan State University and the University of Maryland via the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) concluded: ""We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers. Instead, race-specific crime strongly predicts civilian race. This suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings"" and ""Examination of National Violent Death Reporting System data shows racial differences across types of fatal shootings. Black civilians fatally shot by police (relative to White civilians) are more likely to be unarmed and less likely to pose an immediate threat to officers. In contrast, White civilians (relative to Black civilians) are nearly three times more likely to be fatally shot by police when the incident is related to mental-health concerns and are seven times more likely to commit 'suicide by cop'"".

[Bonus points: the Vice President of Research & Innovation at Michigan](https://www.thecollegefix.com/scholar-forced-to-resign-over-study-that-found-police-shootings-not-biased-against-blacks/) was forced to resign partially due to his contrary findings that stated there was no racism in police shootings, which was among his other ""racist science"" that some faculty and students found offensive.

[2018 Study from Michigan State and Arizona State University concluded](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618775108): ""When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-Black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. Multiverse analyses showed only one significant anti-Black disparity of 144 possible tests. Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for Blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.""

[2016 Study from Washington State University via American Society of Criminology concluded](https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/208/2016/08/Police-Reverse-Racism-Effect_-James_James-_Vila-2016-Criminology__Public_Policy.pdf): ""We found that, despite clear evidence of implicit bias against Black suspects, officers were slower to shoot armed Black suspects than armed White suspects, and they were less likely to shoot unarmed Black suspects than unarmed White suspects. These findings challenge the assumption that implicit racial bias affects police behavior in deadly encounters with Black suspects.""

[2016 Study from Harvard via the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399): ""On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of officer-involved shootings.""

[2018 Follow-up Study from Harvard via the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24238): ""In stark contrast, Fryer (forthcoming) finds that, conditional on a police interaction, there are no racial differences in OIS on either the extensive or intensive margins. Using data from Houston, Texas – where I have both OIS and a randomly chosen set of interactions with police where lethal force may have been justified but was not used – I find, after controlling for suspect demographics, officer demographics, encounter characteristics, suspect weapon and year fixed effects, that blacks are 27.4 percent less likely to be shot at by police relative to non-black, non-Hispanics. Investigating the intensive margin – who shoots first in an encounter with police or how many bullets were discharged in the endeavor – there are no detectable racial differences.""

[2018 Study from Rutgars University and Kookmin University and Purdue College concluded](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325874094_Do_White_Law_Enforcement_Officers_Target_Minority_Suspects): ""This article aims to answer this question: are white police officers more likely to use lethal force on minority suspects or people of a specific race? To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015. They find that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police, white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers""

[2016 Study from the Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation, Curtin University, University of Columbia found](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27): ""On average, an estimated 34 people were killed or medically treated for injury by law enforcement per 10 000 stops/arrests. That ratio is surprisingly consistent by race/ethnicity. Blacks have high arrest and stop rates, and per capita are much more likely than whites to die at the hands of police. However, when blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely than whites to be injured or die during that incident.Consistent with our findings, simulation studies find police are no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed whites, and high rates of black speeding citations per capita result from high violation rates. A systematic review identified 10 studies that found suspect race/ethnicity did not predict use of force or its escalation. However, one study found blacks were more likely than whites to face force during compliance checks. The PPCS survey also found that blacks were more likely to experience physical force and to perceive the threat of force during a stop, although few respondents actually were injured by the force applied. The large majority of incidents that those stopped perceived as undue force was stops where officers shouted at or threatened people, presumably to deter resistance.""",-1,"black lives matter movement largest scale mass hysteria incident modern history - depth discussionthe blm movement going remembered one society 's largest scale incidents mass hysteria built overt lies hatred . nature support , hundreds thousands otherwise good people socially endorsing violence arises hateful `` causes `` based utter fabrications . **the definition terrorism : use violence threats intimidate coerce , especially political purposes . ** whether support cause , blm antifa organizations fit literal definition terrorism . n't call , 's fine , recently neither american government , merely saying n't terrorists might think reason actions subjective opinion something otherwise objective fact . blm/antifa supporters responsible great number increasingly violent attacks recent years targeted towards opposing views ( namely white people trump supporters ) , 've earned ire 's currently directed towards .

421,Hidin' Biden,"Hey, everybody, I wanted to get anybody's opinions on the different campaign strategies that Trump and Biden are implementing. Trump is holding outdoor rallies where masks are recommended, but not required. Most people are wearing masks based on the rallies I have seen so far. It looks like Trump is going to travel to all of the battleground states. Trump is readily available to take questions from the (often times hostile) press, as he's always been. He is even willing to debate Biden on Joe Rogan's podcast. The energy is high at his rallies. It reminds me so much of the 2016 campaign. 

On the other hand, I am shocked at what I have seen from the other side. Biden has stated that he won't have any rallies. He's had limited exposure in which he speaks in front of a tiny audience. He hasn't really been to many places. He has shirked questions from the media, even putting a ""press lid"" Saturday morning after Ginsburg died when he probably should have taken the opportunity to get out to DC and drum up support. Whenever Biden talks, he sounds so incoherent and, as Trump would say, ""low energy."" I just haven't seen anything really from their campaign that's exciting that would make the swing independent voter think ""this man wants to be the Commander in Chief.""

I know that these are crazy times that we are living in with COVID, but man, I am really shocked at what I am seeing from the Dems. It's almost as if they think they have the election in the bag based on polling numbers (which I don't trust or take seriously). But if Trump is out there with high energy talking to people, doesn't that show how much he wants to remain President?  

I just want to gauge peoples' opinions about the campaign strategies. Who do you think has the better strategy? Is it smarter for Trump to hold outdoor rallies so he can actually campaign and show that lie should go on despite the pandemic? Or is it smarter for the Biden campaign to bunker down to show how much they have taken COVID seriously? 

Thanks.",-1,"hidin ' bidenhey , everybody , wanted get anybody 's opinions different campaign strategies trump biden implementing . trump holding outdoor rallies masks recommended , required . people wearing masks based rallies seen far . looks like trump going travel battleground states . trump readily available take questions ( often times hostile ) press , 's always . even willing debate biden joe rogan 's podcast . energy high rallies . reminds much 2016 campaign . hand , shocked seen side . biden stated wo n't rallies .

672,Longtime D voting R this year,"As I reminded myself this is the same media from 2001 that convinced their own people it was okay to bomb and completely destabilize the Middle East “because they had ISIS”, I decided to open my mind.

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump’s and Biden’s and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump’s. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn’t even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden’s rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by “People didn’t treat them like black people” is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn’t my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let’s continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays. If you still don’t agree with me, I still love you and will never treat you differently solely because of your political stance.

705,The real truth about Trump,"Real Coffee with Scott Adams is worth listening to regularly because Adams, like Trump, is an out-of-the-box thinker.  During one of his recent shows, Adams framed Trump uniquely and insightfully.  According to Adams, while Trump may falter on smaller decisions (why, oh why, did he waste time talking to Woodward?), his gift is his ability to do the impossible.  In other words, when everyone says something can't be done, Trump's response is a version of ""here, hold my beer"" (or, as he's a teetotaler, ""hold my soda"").  Tell Trump something's impossible, and he goes and makes it possible.

I was not on Team Trump in the beginning.  What changed my mind was having a New York friend tell me, ""Trump gets things done that no one else can.""  The example she gave me, something about which I was ignorant since I'm not a New Yorker, was Trump and the Wollman Skating Rink.

The rink was a city-owned property that had fallen into disrepair during the 1970s.  By 1980, the city was planning to refurbish, a project it said would take two years.  Six years and $13 million later, the work already done was wrong, and the city announced that it had to start over.  In May 1986, Trump, then 39, told Mayor Ed Koch that if the mayor handed the project to him, Trump would have the rink ready by Christmas for less than $3 million, none of which would be a profit to Trump.

As it happened, Trump did not do what he had promised.  Instead, he did the impossible by hugely exceeding expectations.  Trump finished the job in four months and came in 25% under budget.  According to my friend, New Yorkers understood that if Trump undertook a task, he'd do it, and do it well.  He would achieve the impossible.

Remember how Barack Obama, during the campaign, talked down Trump's promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and improve the economy?  Obama could not have been more snide or dismissive:

""Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There's no answer to it,"" Obama said.

""He just says, 'Well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.' Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.""

Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" and, until the Democrats took a hacksaw to the economy with their Wuhan virus overreach, Trump waved his magic wand all over the economy.  By July 2019, Forbes was reporting:

In the last 30 months of President Obama's term, manufacturing employment grew by 185,000 or 1.5%. In President Trump's first 30 months, manufacturers added 499,000 jobs, expanding by 4.0%. In the same 30-month time span during the mature, post-recovery phase of the business cycle, some 314,000 more manufacturing jobs were added under Trump than under Obama, a 170% advantage.

We were told that the sluggish economic growth rate that Obama oversaw was the new normal.  Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" and, by September 2019, before the lockdown tried to end the party, Trump had the economy chugging along at rates unseen in decades: incomes, especially in the lower brackets, increased at 3.4% annually; poverty declined to 11.8%; unemployment dropped to the lowest in decades, with the most significant benefits flowing to minorities and women; and the number of families in the lowest economic bracket dropped by 1%.

Everyone predicted dire outcomes if Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" moved the embassy...and that proceeded so well that he also announced that Israel has sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

And everyone said there could be no peace in the Middle East.  After all, if Obama couldn't make that miracle happen (and, instead, oversaw ISIS's rise, an Egyptian fundamentalist revival, the Syrian civil war, and Libya's collapse), then Trump definitely couldn't bring about peace.  Again, Trump said, ""Hold my soda"" and began getting the Sunni nations, one after another, to normalize relations with Israel.

Trump did this with a new paradigm that cut the Palestinians out of the loop and sold the Sunnis on the wonders of peace and prosperity with Israel as an ally, not an enemy.  The UAE and Bahrain are on board, and Trump promises — and it's reasonable to believe — that all the Sunni nations will follow.

And so will end 72 years of alternately hot and cold, but always hostile, relations between Israel and her neighbors.  The UAE is changing its schools' curricula to support Israel, and Saudi's imam of the Grand Mosque demands that Muslims treat Jews well.  It's big; it's real; and for Trump, it wasn't impossible.

I'll end with an optimistic poem that Edgar Albert Guest wrote early in the 20th century.  It seems appropriate here:

It Couldn't Be Done

Somebody said that it couldn't be done

      But he with a chuckle replied

That ""maybe it couldn't,"" but he would be one

      Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.

So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin

      On his face. If he worried he hid it.

He started to sing as he tackled the thing

      That couldn't be done, and he did it!

 

Somebody scoffed: ""Oh, you'll never do that;

      At least no one ever has done it;""

But he took off his coat and he took off his hat

      And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.

With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,

      Without any doubting or quiddit,

He started to sing as he tackled the thing

      That couldn't be done, and he did it.

 

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,

      There are thousands to prophesy failure,

There are thousands to point out to you one by one,

      The dangers that wait to assail you.

But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,

      Just take off your coat and go to it;

Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing

      That ""cannot be done,"" and you'll do it.",-1,"real truth trumpreal coffee scott adams worth listening regularly adams , like trump , out-of-the-box thinker . one recent shows , adams framed trump uniquely insightfully . according adams , trump may falter smaller decisions ( , oh , waste time talking woodward ? ) , gift ability impossible . words , everyone says something ca n't done , trump 's response version `` , hold beer `` ( , 's teetotaler , `` hold soda `` ) . tell trump something 's impossible , goes makes possible . team trump beginning . changed mind new york friend tell , `` trump gets things done one else . `` example gave , something ignorant since 'm new yorker , trump wollman skating rink . rink city-owned property fallen disrepair 1970s . 1980 , city planning refurbish , project said would take two years . six years $ 13 million later , work already done wrong , city announced start . may 1986 , trump , 39 , told mayor ed koch mayor handed project , trump would rink ready christmas less $ 3 million , none would profit trump . happened , trump promised . instead , impossible hugely exceeding expectations . trump finished job four months came 25 % budget . according friend , new yorkers understood trump undertook task , 'd , well . would achieve impossible . remember barack obama , campaign , talked trump 's promise bring manufacturing jobs back u.s. improve economy ? obama could snide dismissive : `` well , exactly going ? exactly going ?

765,"If you are a smug Democrat or leftist coming here to see how ""stupid"" we are...","- Trump is trying to encourage peace in the world.  He's making moves to end the wars we are in.  

**Democrats have brought the violence here to our streets.  They are failing to condemn it and normalizing the idea that even more will happen if they don't get what they want.**

- You tell us Black Lives Matter is just about better police treatment of black people.

**Trump doesn't control the police, so why were people trying to storm the White House?**

- It's just about ""unfair treatment"".

**Why do you all ignore the ACTUAL justice reform that Trump signed?**

 - You think we care nothing about people's lives.

**But you don't say anything about states that passed bills making it legal to abort a child literally as it's being born.**

 - You think we are selfish for wanting to go to church.

**How many crowded funerals did George Floyd get, again?**

 - You chose Biden and try to sell him as a reasonable centrist.

**We know that he may have been that 20 years ago, but he's changed his agenda to be far more ""progressive.""**

 - You call us fear-mongers when we point out that the Democrats have gone a lot further left.

**Bernie and AOC have both said that the far left side of the Democrat party will be able to move Biden even FURTHER left.**

 - You tell us we're ""selfish, greedy bastards.""

**Republicans give more than Democrats do to charity, and do so at all levels of income.**



 - You say that Trump is going to have roaming bands of Nazi brownshirts on the streets terrorizing people.

**You are now gathering to harass diners trying to eat meals outside...demanding they raise their fists, political figures trying to have dinner are being accosted, conservative journalists have had to move from their homes, you are shouting death threats outside the Senate Majority leader's house and now BLM apparently has a group targeting racist ""citizens"" to show up at their homes...**

 - You say that WE are ""in a cult"".

**You have most major media giving you talking points that you agree with and you discuss how you've had to cut actual family and friends out of your life because they like ""Mango Mussolini"".**

 - You say that you are the ones who love minorities.

**The vitriol that you express towards any member of a minority group that champions conservative beliefs is testimony that you do not.**

 - You say that taking our kids to church is child abuse because they are impressionable.

**But when kids are taken to riots by antifa parents and tear gas is deployed, it's the cops' fault for endangering the kids.**

 - You say that you love America.

**You voted for a dude that wanted it fundamentally transformed...you say that ""it was never great"" and some of you are openly wanting a socialist state and you are burning American flags in the streets now.**

 - Teachers are concerned that ""conservative parents"" might overhear the lessons they are teaching our kids.

**You think they have a right to be scared of the parents who are paying their salaries.**

 - You snidely said, ""All buildings matter"" on 9/11.

**BLM Riots Are Officially the Most Costly Man made Damage to American Property in History**

 - You think you are the ones who understand civics.

**You still insist that Hillary *really* won the 2016 election.**

 - You used to deny being socialists.

**Now you often try to make self-posts here asking us, ""What's wrong with having socialism?""**

 - You think that kids making MAGA videos is wrong and exploitative.

**But at the same age it's okay for other kids to do dancing in drag at strip clubs.**

 - You say that we need to have tough conversations about controversial issues.

**But if we have those conversations, you demand that we agree with you or we are accused of engaging in hateful speech.**

 - You demand that subreddits that seem to encourage violence and are conservative be ""shut down"".

**You defend subreddits that advocate violence from the side that is currently PERPETRATING violence in the streets.**

 - You complained when re open protests had armed people at them.

**A member of a black militia actually opened fire accidentally at a BLM protest and shot three comrades in Louisville.  We never hear about it.**

 - You think we're poorly informed due to the terrible media we consume.

**You still don't know the true story of what happened to the Covington kids in DC and you still want Nick Sandmann to suffer for that hate-smirk.**

 - You think that Russia somehow nefariously influenced the last election via social media.

**But you never question who might be behind your favorite left-wing social media sites and posts.**

 - Trump has increased troop pay, improved military readiness, invested in support and worked for REAL reform for a VA long beleaguered by problems.

**You tried to float the idea that Trump hates the troops.**

 - When people say that they are scared to put up a sign supporting the President, many of you say, ""Good... you should be scared.""

**You demand your right to espouse WHATEVER political beliefs you want to, even if you are a commie who wants gulags and if we object, it's McCarthyism.**

 - You said it was grossly offensive, horrible, awful and racist to blame the virus on China.

**But every day you slog on trying to blame the virus on Trump.**

 - You complain at how the virus is decimating the economy.

**But you don't care that the House won't get together with the Senate to cooperate on a Covid relief bill.**

 - You think it's too dangerous to vote in person.

**But you think these protests just *have to happen* because the cause is too important.**

 - You berate conservatives when you see them posting on other subreddits.

**But you get mad when you come here to berate us and you get banned for it.**

 - You think that white people are clueless and pretty racist and generally kinda bad and responsible for most of the suffering in the world.

**But you want us to adopt the Nordic model of healthcare.**

 - You are LGBTQ+ - supportive!

**... but when 45% of gay men say that they are backing Trump...SUDDENLY they are ""immoral.""**

 - You've spent years blaming anti-vaxx on ""the right.""

**But when Biden and Harris suggested that they wouldn't trust a Covid 19 vaccine because Trump is President, you were silent.  They lied, people died?**

 - You keep insisting that the USA is the worst nation at dealing with Covid...

**Per population, seven other countries have done ""worse""...they are Belgium, the UK, Spain, Peru, Italy, Sweden and Chile.**

 - You seem to oppose any measure that would make our vote more secure and less prone to fraud.  You insist that fraud doesn't happen.

**But you are yelling that somehow Republicans are going to steal the election via some nebulous voter fraud.**

 - It's called ""redistricting"" when you Democrats make voting districts.  You say that it's fixing longstanding problems of representation in populations.

**If the Republicans do the same you scream that it's ""gerrymandering that is ruining democracy.""**

 - You think that our only objections to Obama were mustard and that tan suit.  And only because we are racist.

**IRS scandal, unconstitutional DACA, health reform disaster, Fast and Furious, disappearing stimulus money, spying on journalists and persecuting Fox, Iran pallets of cash, incoherent Middle East policy...to name a few...**

 - You suddenly think you need guns because Trump is ""worse than Hitler"" and you might need to protect yourself from the government.

**You are going to vote for a man who just tweeted that he's going to take the guns.**

 - You think it's cute that Joe Biden played ""Despacito"" on his phone to win over Latino voters.

**Latino voters know that the lyrics to that song are:** 

**Slowly**

**I want to breathe in your neck slowly**

**Let me murmur things in your ear**

**So that you remember if you’re not with me**

**Slowly**

**I want to undress you in kisses slowly**

**Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth**

**And of your body, I want to create a manuscript**

#Mostly folks, you know ... we've NOTICED.

We have noticed these things.  

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

917,"My Problem with r/Politics, and Why I’m Republican","I’m sure someone has said something about this before, but here is my opinion, why I am now a Republican, and why I will never associate politically with people who are Democrats.

My first problem is with r/Politics. I’ve slowly comes to realize it is literally all democrats. This alone isn’t a problem - the problem is they delete and attack anybody who is Pro-Trump, or Republican in general. You are not allowed to post things like Biden’s VP pick calling him a pedophile, or anything bad about her since she is an African American woman.

Why am I now Republican? I’ll be honest, I voted blue in 2016. I’ve never had a president who was upfront and brutally honest. I never knew about ‘fake media’, I was simply just brainwashed into thinking ‘orange man bad’. Over the years I’ve come to realize I feel like I have more freedom and opportunities. Trump has lowered taxes, cap rates, and has overall increased my wealth substantially in 4 years. He’s denuclearized one of the most deadly places, killed an extremely dangerous Islamic state leader, and so much more thats made me start doing my own research about him instead of coming home, listening to CNN for dinner, and going to sleep. 

Now finally, why I won’t associate politically with people who are democrats. The first incident happened when one of my black friends openly stated he didn’t support BLM because they do nothing about people in Chicago. He was then attacked ruthlessly, people called him “white-washed”, and all sorts of crap like that. He was attacked for being an African American with an opinion, and BLM supporters / Democrats would not accept that. The next incident happened to my Asian American girl that was my friend. She posted something saying “Happy Birthday Donald Trump”. Seems quite innocent right? Wrong! People came out once again, called her a “pick me girl”, “attention whore”, slut shamming her, just the most upsetting shit.

I’m scared to vote by mail, I’m scared to say my opinion without being anonymous. They are a deadly party that kills and does a lot more harm than help. 

Sorry if this is extremely long, every cell in my body is just brutally pissed off.

TL:DR: Democrats oppress people they’re trying to give freedom to.",-1,"problem r/politics , ’ republicani ’ sure someone said something , opinion , republican , never associate politically people democrats . first problem r/politics . ’ slowly comes realize literally democrats . alone ’ problem - problem delete attack anybody pro-trump , republican general . allowed post things like biden ’ vp pick calling pedophile , anything bad since african american woman . republican ? ’ honest , voted blue 2016 . ’ never president upfront brutally honest . never knew ‘ fake media ’ , simply brainwashed thinking ‘ orange man bad ’ . years ’ come realize feel like freedom opportunities . trump lowered taxes , cap rates , overall increased wealth substantially 4 years . ’ denuclearized one deadly places , killed extremely dangerous islamic state leader , much thats made start research instead coming home , listening cnn dinner , going sleep . finally , ’ associate politically people democrats . first incident happened one black friends openly stated ’ support blm nothing people chicago . attacked ruthlessly , people called “ white-washed ” , sorts crap like . attacked african american opinion , blm supporters / democrats would accept . next incident happened asian american girl friend . posted something saying “ happy birthday donald trump ” . seems quite innocent right ? wrong ! people came , called “ pick girl ” , “ attention whore ” , slut shamming , upsetting shit . ’ scared vote mail , ’ scared say opinion without anonymous . deadly party kills lot harm help . sorry extremely long , every cell body brutally pissed . tl : dr : democrats oppress people ’ trying give freedom ."

In the last Presidential election, Donald Trump was lauded for his performance among black voters – he scored 4 percent of female black voters and a whopping 13 percent of black male voters, the highest since Richard Nixon. This isn’t shocking. Black voters have voted en masse for the Democratic Party since the mid-60s and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the social welfare programs of the Great Society. This solidified black voters behind the Democratic Party, but they had been moving there since the New Deal.

However, it’s a historical anomaly in the United States. The traditional home of the black voter was the Republican Party, due to its historical role in ending slavery and introducing Reconstruction Acts and Amendments to the Constitution. It also did not help that the Democratic Party was the party of Jim Crow, a system of legally enforced segregation present throughout the American South in the aftermath of the Civil War.

**What Do We Mean When We Say “Jim Crow?”**

Before delving further into the topic, it is important to define precisely what we mean by Jim Crow and why it is a distinct form of legal codes in United States history. While Northern and Western cities were by no means integrated, this integration was de facto, not de jure. In many cases, the discrimination in the North was a discrimination of custom and preference, discrimination that could not be removed without a highly intrusive government action ensuring equality of outcome. Northerners and Westerners were not required to discriminate, but nor were they forbidden from doing so.

Compare this to the series of laws in the American South known for mandating segregation at everything from public schools to water fountains.

No one is entirely sure where the term “Jim Crow” came from, but it’s suspected that it comes from an old minstrel show song and dance routine called “Jump Jim Crow.” Curiously, the first political application of the term “Jim Crow” was applied to the white populist supporters of President Andrew Jackson. The history of the Jim Crow phenomenon we are discussing here goes back to the end of Reconstruction in the United States.

**The Reconstruction Era**

Briefly, Reconstruction was the means by which the federal government reasserted control over the Southern states that had previously seceded to form the Confederate States of America. This involved military occupation and the disenfranchisement of the bulk of the white population of the states. The results of the Reconstruction Era were mixed. Ultimately, Reconstruction ended as part of a bargain to put President Rutherford B. Hayes into the White House after the 1876 election. The lasting results of Reconstruction are best enumerated for our purposes as the Reconstruction Amendments:

• The 13th Amendment abolished involuntary servitude for anyone other than criminals. It was once voted down and passed only through the extensive political maneuvering on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln himself and the approval of dubious Reconstruction state governments in the South. It became law in December 1865.

• The 14th Amendment includes a number of provisions often thought to be part of the Bill of Rights, such as the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause, which are, in fact, later innovations. Birthright citizenship’s advocates claim that the Constitutional justification can be found in this sprawling Amendment, which also includes Amendments barring former Confederate officials from office and addresses Confederate war debts. This Amendment became law in July 1868.

• The 15th Amendment prevents discrimination against voters on the basis of race or skin color. This law was quickly circumvented by a number of laws discriminating against all voters on the basis of income (poll tax) or education (literacy tests). The Southern states eventually figured out how to prevent black citizens from voting while allowing white ones through grandfather clauses.

The Reconstruction Amendments were the first amendments to the Constitution passed in almost 60 years, and represented a significant expansion of federal power.

Perhaps the most important thing to know about the Reconstruction Amendments is that they were largely ineffective. Ranking public officials of the Confederacy were elected to federal government, blacks were disenfranchised as quickly as they were elected to the Senate, and Jim Crow, an entire system of legal discrimination, was erected to return black Americans to their subservient status. With the exception of citizenship for blacks and an end to involuntary servitude, the substance of the rest of the Amendments were largely discarded.

**Black Disenfranchisement as a Prologue to Jim Crow**

The process of black disenfranchisement at the end of the war is important historical context for understanding the rise of Jim Crow. It’s impossible to discuss this period without discussing the role of the Ku Klux Klan and other Democratic Party-allied white supremacist terrorist organizations. You can read more about this in our lengthy and exhaustive history of American militias and paramilitary organizations.

The first attempt to roll back the gains made by black Americans, thanks to the Reconstruction Amendments, was a poll tax introduced by Georgia in 1877. However, the legal rollback of voting rights in particular did not really ramp up until the turn of the century, when Republicans ran on joint tickets with the insurgent People’s Party, also known as the Populist Party. This threat to entrenched Democratic Party political power (and all of the patronage that came with it), while certainly related to the racial question, was arguably a bigger motivator than race. In many cases, such as with poll taxes, there were explicit attempts to exclude white voters sympathetic to the Republican cause alongside black voters. The specter of unity between poor blacks and poor whites loomed large.

Mississippi drafted a new constitution in 1890, which required payment of a poll tax as well as the passing of a literacy test as qualifications to vote. This passed Constitutional muster in 1898, with Williams vs. Mississippi. Other Southern states quickly drafted new constitutions modelled on that of Mississippi. This was known as “the Mississippi Plan.” By 1908, every Southern state had either drafted a new constitution or passed a suffrage amendment to better craft the state electorate to their liking. In 1903, Giles vs. Harris strengthened federal court support of such laws.

Another method of maintaining control was the white primary. In 1923, Texas became the first state to establish primary voting for whites only. This was quickly deemed unconstitutional, so the state simply drafted a new law saying that the Democratic Party could determine its own voters for the primary. The state party quickly moved to exclude all non-white voters, which was entirely legal and Constitutional, because the Democratic Party was a private organization.

This caught the eye of some Congressmen. By 1900, there was discussion of stripping Southern states of some of their Congressional representation in accordance with provisions contained within the Reconstruction Amendments. Not only was the “Solid South” a large voting bloc, due to the one-party nature of many Southern elections, but they were also in charge of a goodly number of committee chairs, meaning that any attempt to strip Southern states of seats was probably going to go precisely nowhere.

Reliable statistics from the era are few and far between, but historians believe that somewhere between one and five percent of eligible black voters were registered by the late 1930s. Very few of these actually voted in general elections, which were a foregone conclusion. In many states, prior to the first and second Great Migrations, the black population ranged upwards of close to 50 percent.

Five border states (Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland) all attempted to pass similar legislation to “the Mississippi Plan,” but failed to do so.

**Redeemer Governments and the Election of 1876**

The disenfranchisement of black Americans in the South was the political precursor for Jim Crow. In addition to legal disenfranchisement, there were also paramilitary actions against both black Americans and Republican voters and candidates. It was not uncommon for Democratic Party-allied paramilitary groups to simply force the Republican candidate or even office holder out of town. Voter fraud was also a tool. As elections became closer, violence against blacks and Republicans increased to keep them away from the polls.

These Southern governments are known collectively as the Redeemer governments. They ruled over most of the South from 1870 until 1910. As we discuss in our history of militias in the United States, the white, pro-Democratic Party militias of the South were largely obsolete by the end of the 19th Century – Democratic Party state governments were doing their jobs for them.

All of this was facilitated by the Compromise of 1877 or the Corrupt Bargain of 1877, depending on one’s point of view. In exchange for certifying Southern votes for Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, Hayes agreed to:

• Remove federal troops from Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana, the final states where they remained. Hayes campaigned on doing this prior to the bargain.

• The appointment of one or more Southerners to the Hayes Cabinet. This was fulfilled by appointing David M. Key from Tennessee as the Postmaster General.

• A transcontinental railroad passing through the South, using the Texas and Pacific line.

• Legislation to industrialize the Southern economy.

• Northern hands off the South when it came to racial questions.

The first two are often emphasized, however, they are probably the least important parts of the compromise. As stated above, Hayes had already planned to withdraw the remaining troops from the South. The cabinet appointment of Postmaster General was certainly a bigger deal than it would be today, when far fewer people rely upon the mail. The post has not even been a cabinet-level position since the 1970s. The next two are arguably beneficial to everyone in the South, black or white, and in any event, were never enacted.

It’s also worth noting that the Compromise was seen as a way to avoid a potential new wave of bloodshed. At the time, it was widely feared that American politics were going to go the way of Mexico – meaning military strongmen and state violence would resolve closely contested elections. In this context, the Compromise is rather shrewd as Hayes gave up very little with regard to the first two provisions and never enacted points three and four.

The final provision, however, is the one that makes Jim Crow possible. This makes it, historically speaking, perhaps the most significant of the Compromise provisions.

950,Yard Signs,"
Shortly after Trump was elected president, “HATE HAS NO HOME HERE” (HHNHH) yard signs began adorning the minority-manicured lawns of white-collar, white-skinned liberals.  You’ve seen the sign.  Its message is translated into multiple languages, which is meant to broadcast a globalist diversity of sorts by those who speak not only just English, but that sniffy dialect molded within the narrow confines of a university pedigree loftier than junior college but conspicuously short of Ivy League.  You can all but hear them finish their Starbucks order with that irritating raised inflection on the last syllable. 

The underlying message of the HHNHH yard sign is two-fold.  First, it’s virtue signaling in its most tawdry form.  Yard signs announcing “POVERTY IS BAD” and “I SUPPORT CURING CANCER” would ring just as hollow.  Sorry, but you don’t get a cookie for broadcasting to the world that you oppose hate.  Most people do, and their daily actions are sufficient proof thereof.  A lion doesn’t need to convince people it’s a lion.

Second, the HHNHH yard sign alludes that a home which opposes President Trump is axiomatically hate-free, and, by deductive logic, a home which supports President Trump categorically welcomes hate with open arms.  The sign smugly implies, “I'm a good person, and it's a shame that you're not.”  This insinuation might not rise to the level of hate, but it certainly sinks to the level of arrogance, condescension, and sweeping judgment.  

But over time the HHNHH yard signs faded along with the “I’m With Her” bumper stickers.  The yard sign prophets needed something new, something snarkier, with which to impress their woke comrades and irritate the handyman who lives on the street’s only single story home.  So a new yard sign was handed out that reads like a manifesto.  The sign blares loudly “WE BELIEVE:”, which is followed by (in differing order, and with slightly altered wording, depending on the sign) BLACK LIVES MATTER; NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL; WOMEN’S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS; LOVE IS LOVE; SCIENCE IS REAL; and KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING. 



They really upped the ante, didn’t they?

The first thought conservatives have looking at this sign is that they agree with every statement on it.  But the purpose of the sign is not to find common ground across the political spectrum, but to further drive a wedge.  The purpose of the sign is to insist that these statements are true only within the narrow ideological limits of the sign owner’s worldview.  If you disagree with the yard sign prophets on any policy point, then, in their minds, you disagree with the statements themselves.  

Let’s break it down by statement:

BLACK LIVES MATTER

Aside from progressive mayors, BLM rioters, and Dylan Roof, one is hard-pressed to find Americans of any political persuasion who behave like black lives don’t matter.  In fact, conservatives take this statement to the next logical steps.  Black lives, White lives and Hispanic lives matter.  Unborn lives matter and police lives matter. 

But by declaring BLACK LIVES MATTER, they are concerned only with black people who have been shot by police.  The justification for the shooting, or the lack thereof, or any other pertinent fact of a specific case, does not factor into their reasoning.  The black victim is merely a prop, brutishly exploited to peddle an anti-police narrative.

But don’t posit to a yard sign prophet any of these seemingly a priori statements without first donning a face shield, because spittle will most definitely fly.  By insisting that all lives matter rather than just those of a single race, you are somehow the racist.  Now that’s a trick that would leave even Houdini scratching his head. 

NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL

Who is saying that humans are illegal?  It's a conservative idea that human beings not only have a legal right to peacefully exist to pursue their happiness, but should be legally protected at all stages of life, at all income levels, and in every neighborhood.  What this statement is attacking is the concept of illegal immigration.  But a person's immigration status is very different from their right to exist, as the yard sign prophets surely know.  That is why they obfuscate the argument with underhanded statements like this.  Those who scream NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL do so from the safety of their alarmed homes and gated communities, which serve essentially the same purpose as does a border wall. 

WOMEN’S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS

Who is saying they aren’t?  Certainly not conservatives, for whom human rights (be they for women, gays, ethnic or religious minorities) aren’t conveniently ignored when the offending societies are non-Western.  There are plenty who do treat women like animals and slaves, and who use their culture and religion as an excuse to do so.  And which political party courts these misogynists and defends them against ""phobic"" criticisms?

The purpose of this statement isn’t to promote actual equality into cultures for whom the concept of women’s rights is tantamount to heresy.  The statement is abortion advocacy, pure and simple, and it reflects the most threadbare ad hominem attack in American politics, i.e. if you oppose abortion, you oppose women.  This would be news to Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Addams, and other historical dreadnoughts opposed to abortion, in whose mighty wakes meander the empty vessels of contemporary “feminism.”  

LOVE IS LOVE

Sure.  And broccoli is broccoli.  The point of this hackneyed statement is not a defense of “love,” in the sense of a deep and selfless affection from one person to another.  The purpose is to transpose the definition of marriage with that of love, i.e. if you don’t agree with the definition of marriage as progressives do, then you are opposed to “love.”  If you disagree with the institution of gay marriage yet harbor no animosity whatsoever towards the gay community, it matters not.  You are a hateful bigot whose business must be shut down and whose social life must be cancelled. 

This hijacking of “love” as understood by the advocacy of non-traditional marriage in the Western sense is, like the advocacy of “women’s rights,” oddly ambiguous when the boundaries of acceptable marriage expand in directions seemingly at odds with progressivism.  The LOVE IS LOVE windbags are uncharacteristically quiet about the legal codes in certain non-Western cultures which allow one man to have (own) multiple wives.  Likewise, they are quiet about speaking out against (or for) definitions of “love” and marriage as insisted upon by the likes of NAMBLA.  Whatever doesn’t fit the narrative is ignored.

SCIENCE IS REAL

Science is a process, a methodology employed to determine empirical facts and laws by which we can better understand the world around us.  What science is never is a set of permanently settled, rigid theories that remain immovable despite the ebb and flow of conflicting evidence.  SCIENCE IS REAL was just as true when we “knew” the Earth was flat as when we discovered it was round.  What changed was not the science, but the evidence. 

The SCIENCE IS REAL statement is a transparent reference to global warming, and global warming only.  The statement is meant to ridicule “climate deniers”, i.e. those who “deny” the “settled science” that not only is the Earth warming at logarithmically catastrophic rates, but that mankind (particular Western man) is solely responsible.  These armchair Einsteins have little time for the sciences of biology, genetics, and economics because they don’t conform to the narrative.

One problem with the global warming debate is that it, in its current metamorphosis, is far too politicized from which to derive much objective substance.  The vast majority of partisans on both sides understand very little of the actual science, and instead rely on either conspiracy theories or internet searches for whichever article or chart is tailored to fit their particular bias. 

Since I fall into this category of blissful ignorance, I’m in no position to comment on the science one way or another, though I will say this.  Reasonable skepticism is not anti-scientific, especially when the apocalypse peddlers are batting 0.000 with regards to their predictions ever actually occurring.  I’ll also say that any proposal that punishes Western democracies (who do the most to lower emissions) while subsidizing brutal dictatorships (who do the least) is not a serious solution, but rather a massive transfer of wealth and power unconvincingly cloaked as environmentalism.  Pollution from Chinese smokestacks destroys the planet just as much as pollution from American smokestacks.  This isn’t racism, this is the science you allegedly support.

KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING

This statement can be found in all shapes and sizes in the millennial-old texts of most world religions, but one would struggle to find anything remotely close in the atheistic fanaticism of Karl Marx, Che Guevarra, or Richard Dawkins.   For cultural icons like Bill Maher, Chelsea Handler, and Michael Moore, kindness is more an impediment than a virtue, as are the empathy and tolerance that accompany it.  Our city streets are overflowing with black-masked kindness, and it’ll bash you across the head with a brick if your own kindness is found wanting.

Like its HHNHH predecessor, the WE BELIEVE yard sign isn’t an argument, an ideology, or a philosophy.  It isn’t a set of principles or tenets of a faith.  It has no depth, no complexity, and no animation.  It’s a regurgitation of drive-by gotcha-isms, dutifully parroted with overconfident arrogance and unearned righteousness by those who haven’t thought to the next sentence.

The WE BELIEVE statements are easily dissectible, and should never be allowed to fester unchallenged for the sake of avoiding unpleasant conversation.  The yard sign is designed to elicit shame in its opponents, but there is nothing shameful and everything noble in resisting what Solzhenitsyn called “the mechanical propaganda of dead ideas”.  You won’t make a dent, but they should know that neither did they.",-1,"yard signs shortly trump elected president , “ hate home ” ( hhnhh ) yard signs began adorning minority-manicured lawns white-collar , white-skinned liberals . ’ seen sign . message translated multiple languages , meant broadcast globalist diversity sorts speak english , sniffy dialect molded within narrow confines university pedigree loftier junior college conspicuously short ivy league . hear finish starbucks order irritating raised inflection last syllable . underlying message hhnhh yard sign two-fold . first , ’ virtue signaling tawdry form . yard signs announcing “ poverty bad ” “ support curing cancer ” would ring hollow . sorry , ’ get cookie broadcasting world oppose hate . people , daily actions sufficient proof thereof . lion ’ need convince people ’ lion . second , hhnhh yard sign alludes home opposes president trump axiomatically hate-free , , deductive logic , home supports president trump categorically welcomes hate open arms . sign smugly implies , “ 'm good person , 's shame 're . ” insinuation might rise level hate , certainly sinks level arrogance , condescension , sweeping judgment . time hhnhh yard signs faded along “ ’ ” bumper stickers . yard sign prophets needed something new , something snarkier , impress woke comrades irritate handyman lives street ’ single story home . new yard sign handed reads like manifesto . sign blares loudly “ believe : ” , followed ( differing order , slightly altered wording , depending sign ) black lives matter ; human illegal ; women ’ rights human rights ; love love ; science real ; kindness everything . really upped ante , ’ ? first thought conservatives looking sign agree every statement . purpose sign find common ground across political spectrum , drive wedge . purpose sign insist statements true within narrow ideological limits sign owner ’ worldview . disagree yard sign prophets policy point , , minds , disagree statements . let ’ break statement : black lives matter aside progressive mayors , blm rioters , dylan roof , one hard-pressed find americans political persuasion behave like black lives ’ matter . fact , conservatives take statement next logical steps . black lives , white lives hispanic lives matter . unborn lives matter police lives matter . declaring black lives matter , concerned black people shot police . justification shooting , lack thereof , pertinent fact specific case , factor reasoning . black victim merely prop , brutishly exploited peddle anti-police narrative . ’ posit yard sign prophet seemingly priori statements without first donning face shield , spittle definitely fly . insisting lives matter rather single race , somehow racist . ’ trick would leave even houdini scratching head . human illegal saying humans illegal ?

1117,"Why I, a black teenager, don't agree with black lives matter","Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

What I didn't understand is that the owner also works hard, and was there first. I started working harder and now am in a good place in life.

1473,Reddit needs some serious changes to ensure what happened to the Covington boys and Kyle Rittenhouse can't happen again.,"Right now everybody knows that the Covington boys were entirely in the right and were actually the victims of harassment, but at the time Reddit was going absolutely mental about them. The main kid(age 15) was posted to top of all time on r/punchablefaces. Every major thread was slandering him, every major subreddit was abusing him, calling him a ""white supremacist"" and contacting his school and family.

But he was entirely and unequivocally in the right, he was approached by a racist native American man who started smashing a drum in his face while staring him down, completely unprompted. And the thing is everybody knew that at the time, the video was fully available at the time, but every single post made revealing that truth was deleted. Any post that was slightly leaning towards the truth was removed for random reasons that made no sense and the mods had absolutely zero accountability in how they handled what is arguably the most notorious piece of fake news of this century. The controversy revealed some of the most disgusting aspects of humanity, a witch-hunt against literal innocent children. Luckily the main kid sued and won against CNN for estimated low 9 figures and he's moving on to other networks who misrepresented this.

But for all the shit people give Facebook about not deleting fake news Reddit was so much worse in this instance, not only did they not remove the fake stories, all major subs removed only the truth. Videos abusing the kids were let up on r/videos no problem, but videos that actually explained the truth were removed for ""politics"", same thing on all major subs really, if you knew the truth you weren't able to share it with people and try get them to leave the kids alone. All these people abusing children for something that just didn't happen when the full video is out there is so disgusting to me.

The same thing's happening with Kyle Rittenhouse right now, in fact he's already working with the same lawyers that represented the Covington boys against CNN(media's been a bit more careful in blatantly lying about him since that happened, as they should be). You just can't call him a white supremacist who just started firing against innocent black people as is the mainstream prerogative on Reddit right now. First off because it was the most blatant case of self defense known to man when you watch the video, like there's just absolutely no question whatsoever, and second off because the people he ended up killing in self defense were white. He's clearly recorded wiping up graffiti in the city earlier that day and helping store owners with some of the damage caused by riots. The attackers were shouting ""get his ass"" and one of them actually pulled a handgun on him as well. Kyle showed amazing restraint, only making the decision to defend his life after he was already beaten to the ground after attempting to disengage and flee by sprinting away, but his attackers forced him to the ground and one of them raised their handgun to him.

This truth isn't out there on Reddit though, and it's not like you interpret the events in the video in your own way as well, that's objectively what happened. And lawyers are already unanimous on the fact that the worst thing Kyle can be charged for is underage possession of a firearm. Reddit needs serious oversight on things like this. Its impact is just as significant as Facebook's if not more because people take stories on here more seriously. It can't have default subreddits moderate the site in this clearly biased way leading to blatant lies being spread on issues such as this.",-1,"reddit needs serious changes ensure happened covington boys kyle rittenhouse ca n't happen again.right everybody knows covington boys entirely right actually victims harassment , time reddit going absolutely mental . main kid ( age 15 ) posted top time r/punchablefaces . every major thread slandering , every major subreddit abusing , calling `` white supremacist `` contacting school family . entirely unequivocally right , approached racist native american man started smashing drum face staring , completely unprompted . thing everybody knew time , video fully available time , every single post made revealing truth deleted . post slightly leaning towards truth removed random reasons made sense mods absolutely zero accountability handled arguably notorious piece fake news century . controversy revealed disgusting aspects humanity , witch-hunt literal innocent children . luckily main kid sued cnn estimated low 9 figures 's moving networks misrepresented . shit people give facebook deleting fake news reddit much worse instance , remove fake stories , major subs removed truth . videos abusing kids let r/videos problem , videos actually explained truth removed `` politics `` , thing major subs really , knew truth n't able share people try get leave kids alone . people abusing children something n't happen full video disgusting . thing 's happening kyle rittenhouse right , fact 's already working lawyers represented covington boys cnn ( media 's bit careful blatantly lying since happened , ) . ca n't call white supremacist started firing innocent black people mainstream prerogative reddit right . first blatant case self defense known man watch video , like 's absolutely question whatsoever , second people ended killing self defense white .

This is my first post on here, but need to clear my mind. I'm an Asian American who immigrated to this wonderful country about 12 years ago. This country has given me the opportunity to become someone and to pursuit the American dream. Seeing the way this country is going truly hurts my heart and my patriotic self, from statues being brought down to this movement that no longer have a meaning. At the start of the movement I was all for it, but now, it really has shifted from a completely unrelated issues. I just don't understand how someone can agree with the logic of the left. Nothing they say or do makes any sense. We are going down a path where erasing history is a must.

Sorry, I just had to get this off of my chest because I love this country so much and to see it go this route really hurts. I really hope we win this election for the sake of preserving this wonderful country which it was based upon freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.

I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.

I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.

Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.

If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread.

1762,Evidence Shows Kamala Harris Covered Up Illegal Wiretaps,"Kamala Harris served as California attorney general from 2011 to 2017, when she took her Senate seat.

Riverside County Superior Court judge Helios Hernandez, appointed by Democrat governor Gray Davis, ordered [624](http://theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/) wiretaps in 2014, [almost](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/) five times more than any other American judge, and 44,000 people and over 2 million conversations were tapped. Hernandez even [got 17 wiretap applications](http://www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/) in one day. Some of Hernandez’s wiretaps [have been found to be illegal by prosecutors](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml), leading to the dropping of some cases and the surrender of assets seized by the feds. A [federal judge said](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2016/07/06/riverside-county-wiretaps-judge/86779116/) legal standards “could not have been met” with regard to the Riverside County wiretaps.

The wiretapping scheme coincided with a period of massive revenue gains for the state of California from civil asset forfeitures overseen by Kamala Harris’ office. In 2014, Riverside County [collected more than $3 million](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/asset_forf/2014_af/counties-2014.pdf) in civil asset forfeitures.",-1,"evidence shows kamala harris covered illegal wiretapskamala harris served california attorney general 2011 2017 , took senate seat . riverside county superior court judge helios hernandez , appointed democrat governor gray davis , ordered [ 624 ] ( http : //theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/ ) wiretaps 2014 , [ almost ] ( https : //www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/ ) five times american judge , 44,000 people 2 million conversations tapped . hernandez even [ got 17 wiretap applications ] ( http : //www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/ ) one day . hernandez ’ wiretaps [ found illegal prosecutors ] ( https : //www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml ) , leading dropping cases surrender assets seized feds .

1810,Trump is handling COVID-19 very well,"


I don’t think that most people realize that ~1/2 of all the cases in the country are coming out of New York City and its surroundings. Besides a few other urban centers, COVID-19 is not spreading uncontrollably fast here. Trump has also freed up billions of dollars towards the recovery effort both medically and economically through the recently passed stimulus package, and the declaration of a national emergency *two weeks ago*. Navy hospital ships have also been docked at various ports across the country. Diagnostic tests are also becoming readily available (there’s a drive-thru to get tested near my house) The ratio of sick to healthy in the USA is a lot better than most European nations. Per 1,000,000 people in America, 250 are ill. Compare that with Italy (1M:1,400) Spain (1M:1,350) Switzerland (1M:1,500) and Germany (1M:600) and many others. A week and a half ago the media was bashing Trump for fear mongering and being to harsh, but now they’re saying he’s not doing shit. Many companies based here have also taken tremendous precautions to keep people and their employees distanced and healthy. Contrary to what some may think, an entire nation with 325 million people can’t just take a 3 month holiday and expect everything to be normal once it ends. Though the CDC and the president have made a few bad decisions, they are still doing their job to the best of their ability, and Trump’s latest approval rating shows that (highest point in his presidency thus far)",-1,"trump handling covid-19 well ’ think people realize ~1/2 cases country coming new york city surroundings . besides urban centers , covid-19 spreading uncontrollably fast . trump also freed billions dollars towards recovery effort medically economically recently passed stimulus package , declaration national emergency *two weeks ago* . navy hospital ships also docked various ports across country . diagnostic tests also becoming readily available ( ’ drive-thru get tested near house ) ratio sick healthy usa lot better european nations . per 1,000,000 people america , 250 ill. compare italy ( 1m:1,400 ) spain ( 1m:1,350 ) switzerland ( 1m:1,500 ) germany ( 1m:600 ) many others . week half ago media bashing trump fear mongering harsh , ’ saying ’ shit . many companies based also taken tremendous precautions keep people employees distanced healthy . contrary may think , entire nation 325 million people ’ take 3 month holiday expect everything normal ends . though cdc president made bad decisions , still job best ability , trump ’ latest approval rating shows ( highest point presidency thus far )"

1983,Help an Aussie to Understand,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. I have also post this over at r/democrats where it has been approved, hoping both sides are open for the introspection!

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",-1,"help aussie understandhey , aussie thought/questions looking feedback . also post r/democrats approved , hoping sides open introspection ! , whenever one political leaders shown done something even peers find reprehensible ( trump 's ukraine call , hillary 's private email server ) , immediate reaction whataboutism attacking either leader even dubious individual group across aisle . essentially confirms disapproval favoured leader 's actions , otherwise actions would plainly defensible outright , ? seems dopey yet 9/10 go-to response , know smart cookies sides . n't degree anything party leader crowned king dipstick open criticism . candidates seem ethical rap sheets could circumnavigate globe , item seeming ripe disqualification . parties respectable leaders past people know somebody personal lives respect - possible . thinking dems/republicans critical leaders might actually build environment worthwhile candidates rise , might lead candidates palatable voters across political spectrum ? ever chance vote respectable candidate political leaning n't dripping slime 'd jump . seems like cut nose spite face approach , least spite team . truly , 's going ? first 'd guess 's compassionate understanding make mistakes , really applies one 's team captain 'm left stumped . *disclaimer : sure matter , aussie politicians major parties spineless centrists heavily invested either team . regardless current candidates n't believe aligned values integrity , fortitude equality exclusive property either us party . *"

2030,The New York Times got it right! You can believe them!,"[In 2012 the New York Times did a story on the front page that  “cast grave doubt on the reliability of widespread mail-in voting” and indicated it was “more vulnerable to fraud than conventional voting.”  But now the New York Times says, pshaw, mail in voting is wonderful!  You can believe them now.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-warned-readers-about-vote-by-mail-concerns-in-2012-now-claims-thats-a-false-narrative)

[The 1619 Project by the New York Times claimed that 1619 was the ""true founding"" of the USA and said that the American revolution was a war by white people trying to stop the British from abolishing slavery.  There is ZERO historical evidence to support this claim.  By the way, this links to the World Socialist Website...when you are so full of shit that even the socialists are saying that they hate the smell, you are REALLY full of shit. ](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/22/1619-s22.html)

[The New York Times got multiple Pulitzers for claiming that the Trump campaign had ""repeated"" contact with Russian intelligence officials and colluded with them...a claim which now has been utterly debunked by Peter Strzok's notes and James Comey's own testimony, but the Times never corrected or retracted it.](https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/23/new-fbi-notes-re-debunk-major-nyt-story-highlight-media-collusion-to-produce-russia-hoax/)

[You could write a book about how the New York Times smeared the Duke lacrosse team.](https://www.amazon.com/Until-Proven-Innocent-Correctness-Injustices/dp/0312384866)

[Did their embarrassment over getting the lacrosse team story wrong teach them?  Nope.  They went after the Covington Catholic students, too!](https://norfolkdailynews.com/commentary/finally-some-justice-for-maligned-covington-catholic-student/article_fe363742-3963-11ea-97b7-2304f3f087c2.html)

[And they LOVE anonymous sources who tell them things like, ""Trump will never walk away from trying to make a deal with North Korea and he'll get played like a fool""...and then Trump **actually did** walk  away from the negotiations.](https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/28/media-double-down-after-new-york-times-gets-busted-peddling-fake-news/)

I mean, it's a lot, right?  **A lot of just getting shit totally wrong.**

But the NY Times can't help themselves.  They are willing to fabricate things when the story seems really, really juicy and potentially damaging to someone they don't like.  

**And they REALLY do not like Trump.**

[So of course when they got that ""hey Trump knew Russians had put bounties on our troops and totally ignored it"" story, they couldn't help but be the ones to *break* it.  Of course, by now it has been completely **debunked.**](https://fair.org/home/in-russian-bounty-story-evidence-free-claims-from-nameless-spies-became-fact-overnight/)

Still, it's the *New York Times*, right?  LEGACY MEDIA...the Old Grey Lady, full of gravitas and staffed with true responsible intellectuals...

2071,The case for Donald J. Trump: A comprehensive guide to why we should re-elect him and reject the Democratic party.,"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**™** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it.

**Top-level domain**

**org** top-level domain stands for “organization” and is primarily used for nonprofit websites such as charities, NGOs, open source projects, and educational platforms. This extension was one of the original domains established in 1985, and is therefore perceived as stronger and more credible than newer alternatives.

[https://antiracistaction.org/history/](https://antiracistaction.org/history/)

ORG ? 

They choose ORG in lieu of net, edu, black, biz, etc. while tells me they rather be considered an organization in lieu of a radical

Per the Antifa site “Antifa is not a unified group; it is loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals”

These autonomous bodies are cleverly designed/camouflaged similar to any terrorists organization. Donations are received Worldwide and shared with each autonomous body; its a quasi-independent clandestine cell system. 

**Based on the information above, these cells are well organized and (funded quite well) and cause terrorists activity without a cause to make things better.** 

**18 U.S. Code § 2331:** Terrorism is defined as consisting of activities that ""involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State….intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; influence the policy of a government by intimidation; or…affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping."" 

**Aside from Terrorists activity, what good has Antifa actually attained ?**

To me this was a great report by Ingraham and I wish Trump used more of these statistics when debating, as you can see the net worth of hispanics and african americans improved drastically underneath Trump and he should use these stats in the next debate. Also the act he signed where it gave people the ability to review their jail sentences to see if the punishment really fit the crime which has been helping people out. Those need to be trumps main points during the next debate and I think it can help swing some undecideds towards Trump.",-1,"ingraham angle : 9/30/2020 [ ingraham angle 9/30/2020 ] ( https : //youtu.be/itlgnm_mbey ) great report ingraham wish trump used statistics debating , see net worth hispanics african americans improved drastically underneath trump use stats next debate . also act signed gave people ability review jail sentences see punishment really fit crime helping people . need trumps main points next debate think help swing undecideds towards trump ."
